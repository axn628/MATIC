## CoalCloud Reviews
**Verdict:** CoalCloud’s Suqian BGP VPS targets users who need **domestic-first, high-bandwidth** connectivity with large monthly transfer at **1 Gbps**. The 20% promo brings the entry plan down to **¥249.59/mo**, making the 10 TB tier compelling for content distribution, acceleration, and bandwidth-heavy workloads within China. The trade-offs are relatively small SSD volumes (20 GB) and the need for real-name verification. For pure international workloads, confirm performance to your target regions since routes prioritize China Mobile egress.

**Pros**
- BGP routing with China Mobile international egress  
- 1 Gbps bandwidth across all plans  
- Large traffic quotas (10–100 TB)  
- Simple tiers and instant purchase links

**Cons**
- 20 GB SSD may require external storage for larger apps  
- Real-name verification required  
- Single IPv4 per instance by default
